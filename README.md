# Data Literacy project 
### by Tobias Ziefle and Johannes Gaus

We are planning to use the collection of  1.2M Spotify Songs by Rodolfo Figueroa to see how the general length of songs 
has changed over time due to the rising popularity of music streaming services and their artist payment guidelines.
We also want to investigate how the valence of the songs changed over time.  

We are planning to visualize our data with plots to show the development of the average song length and the average valence over time.  
Furthermore, we want to investigate with statistical tests whether the average song length and the average valence differ significantly in 2 different groups.
