# Data Literacy project 
### by Tobias Ziefle and Johannes Gaus

We are planning to use the collection of Spotify 1.2M+ Songs to see how the general length of songs 
has changed over time due to the rising popularity of music streaming services and their payment guidelines.  
We also want to investigate how the valence of the songs changes over time.  
  
We are planning to visualize our data with plots to show the development of the
average song length over time and the development of the valence.  
Furthermore, we want to investigate with statistical tests whether the average song length and the
average valence differs significantly in 2 different groups.
